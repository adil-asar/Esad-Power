Asset Performance Management (APM) - Intelligent Systems Analytics (ISA) 

</h3>

<p  className='indus_para'> 
ESAD has developed a proprietary Intelligent Systems Analytics (ISA)
 prototype based on AI machine learning algorithms. These prototypes 
 are tailor-made for gas turbines, steam turbines, pumps, heat exchangers,
  condensers, and cooling towers and other energy systems assets.
   Historical raw data is filtered and later used in training the
    proprietary model.
    <p  className='indus_para'> 
    </p> Every time the current data is compared with the 
    archive-trained model and identical data sets are segregated. These 
    identical data sets are then further mathematically processed to 
    produce predicted data. The difference between raw data and predicted 
    data provides the anomaly of operation and derives various engineering
     knowledge-based diagnostics alerts custom-designed for a particular
      asset.

Operation Performance Management (OPM)- Advance performance intelligence 
(API)
</h3>
<p  className='indus_para'>
Thermodynamic based models are developed as digital twins to estimate the expected performance of
 whole plant and individual assets. The expected performance then 
compared with current performance of plant to estimate the deviation in performance.

Site reference based corrected performance derivatives are also estimated for certain KPIâ€™s
